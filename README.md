# topicres
Dataset and source code to replicate TopicRes framework used on "Topic Resilience and the Spread of News: Brazilian Cities Case Study"

This repository is composed of five files: one zip folder and four jupyter notebooks.

The zip folder contains the dataset used in the TopicRes study. However, "Data Collection.ipynb" allows anyone to collect their own dataset for analysis.
The next step is to run the dataset on "Topic Detection.ipynb" to identify the topics in the text. 
With the topics detected, it is now possible to run either of the two analysis scripts. The "Topic Resilience.ipynb" provides the calculation of the resilience 
surfaces and the heatmap visualization. The "Topic Influence Network.ipynb" provides the TIN networks for each topic.
